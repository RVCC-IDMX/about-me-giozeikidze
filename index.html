                    <p>Had I been as attentive not to displease him as I ought to have been, I know not but this vigil
                        might have been fulfilled; but I unluckily entered upon the controversy concerning the right of
                        Great-Britain to tax America, and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow-subjects on the
                        other side of the Atlantick. I insisted that America might be very well governed, and made to
                        yield sufficient revenue by the means of INFLUENCE, as exemplified in Ireland, while the people
                        might be pleased with the imagination of their participating of the British constitution, by
                        having a body of representatives, without whose consent money could not be exacted from them.
                        Johnson could not bear my thus opposing his avowed opinion, which he had exerted himself with an
                        extreme degree of heat to enforce; and the violent agitation into which he was thrown, while
                        answering, or rather reprimanding me, alarmed me so, that I heartily repented of my having
                        unthinkingly introduced the subject. I myself, however, grew warm, and the change was great,
                        from the calm state of philosophical discussion in which we had a little before been pleasingly
                        employed.</p>

                    <p>We were fatigued by the contest, which was produced by my want of caution; and he was not then in
                        the humour to slide into easy and cheerful talk. It therefore so happened, that we were after an
                        hour or two very willing to separate and go to bed.</p>

                    <p>On Wednesday, September 24, I went into Dr. Johnson's room before he got up, and finding that the
                        storm of the preceding night was quite laid, I sat down upon his bed-side, and he talked with as
                        much readiness and good-humour as ever. He recommended to me to plant a considerable part of a
                        large moorish farm which I had purchased, and he made several calculations of the expence and
                        profit: for he delighted in exercising his mind on the science of numbers. He pressed upon me
                        the importance of planting at the first in a very sufficient manner, quoting the saying 'In
                        bello non licet bis errare:' and adding, 'this is equally true in planting.'</p>

                    <p>I spoke with gratitude of Dr. Taylor's hospitality; and, as evidence that it was not on account
                        of his good table alone that Johnson visited him often, I mentioned a little anecdote which had
                        escaped my friend's recollection, and at hearing which repeated, he smiled. One evening, when I
                        was sitting with him, Frank delivered this message: 'Sir, Dr. Taylor sends his compliments to
                        you, and begs you will dine with him to-morrow. He has got a hare.'--'My compliments (said
                        Johnson,) and I'll dine with him--hare or rabbit.'</p>

                    <p>After breakfast I departed, and pursued my journey northwards. I took my post-chaise from the
                        Green Man, a very good inn at Ashbourne, the mistress of which, a mighty civil gentlewoman,
                        courtseying very low, presented me with an engraving of the sign of her house; to which she had
                        subjoined, in her own hand-writing, an address in such singular simplicity of style, that I have
                        preserved it pasted upon one of the boards of my original Journal at this time, and shall here
                        insert it for the amusement of my readers:--</p>

                    <p>'M. KILLINGLEY's duty waits upon Mr. Boswell, is exceedingly obliged to him for this favour;
                        whenever he comes this way, hopes for a continuance of the same. Would Mr. Boswell name the
                        house to his extensive acquaintance, it would be a singular favour conferr'd on one who has it
                        not in her power to make any other return but her most grateful thanks, and sincerest prayers
                        for his happiness in time, and in a blessed eternity.--Tuesday morn.'</p>

                    <p>I cannot omit a curious circumstance which occurred at Edensor-inn, close by Chatsworth, to
                        survey the magnificence of which I had gone a considerable way out of my road to Scotland. The
                        inn was then kept by a very jolly landlord, whose name, I think, was Malton. He happened to
                        mention that 'the celebrated Dr. Johnson had been in his house.' I inquired WHO this Dr. Johnson
                        was, that I might hear mine host's notion of him. 'Sir, (said he,) Johnson, the great writer;
                        ODDITY, as they call him. He's the greatest writer in England; he writes for the ministry; he
                        has a correspondence abroad, and lets them know what's going on.'</p>

                    <p>My friend, who had a thorough dependance upon the authenticity of my relation without any
                        EMBELLISHMENT, as FALSEHOOD or FICTION is too gently called, laughed a good deal at this
                        representation of himself.</p>
