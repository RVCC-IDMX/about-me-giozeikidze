            <p>
                I enjoy listening to music and love playing video games. Sports are great for staying active and
                healthy. Driving cars is exciting, and I always look forward to hitting the road.

                <p>Had I been as attentive not to displease him as I ought to have been, I know not but this vigil
                    might have been fulfilled; but I unluckily entered upon the controversy concerning the right of
                    Great-Britain to tax America, and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow-subjects on the
                </p>

                <p>We were fatigued by the contest, which was produced by my want of caution; and he was not then in
                    the humour to slide into easy and cheerful talk. It therefore so happened, that we were after an
                    hour or two very willing to separate and go to bed.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday, September 24, I went into Dr. Johnson's room before he got up, and finding that the
                    storm of the preceding night was quite laid, I sat down upon his bed-side, and he talked with as
                    much readiness and good-humour as ever.</p>

                <p>I spoke with gratitude of Dr. Taylor's hospitality; and, as evidence that it was not on account
                    of his good table alone that Johnson visited him often, I mentioned a little anecdote which had
                    escaped my friend's recollection</p>

                <p>After breakfast I departed, and pursued my journey northwards. I took my post-chaise from the
                    Green Man, a very good inn at Ashbourne, the mistress of which, a mighty civil gentlewoman,
                    courtseying very low, presented me with an engraving of the sign of her house</p>

                <p>M KILLINGLEY's duty waits upon Mr. Boswell, is exceedingly obliged to him for this favour;
                    whenever he comes this way, hopes for a continuance of the same. Would Mr. Boswell name the
                    house to his extensive acquaintance</p>

                <p>I cannot omit a curious circumstance which occurred at Edensor-inn, close by Chatsworth, to
                    survey the magnificence of which I had gone a considerable way out of my road to Scotland. The
                    inn was then kept by a very jolly landlord, whose name, I think, was Malton. He happened to
                    mention that 'the celebrated Dr. Johnson had been in his house.</p>

                <p>My friend, who had a thorough dependance upon the authenticity of my relation without any
                    EMBELLISHMENT, as FALSEHOOD or FICTION is too gently called, laughed a good deal at this
                    representation of himself.</p>
